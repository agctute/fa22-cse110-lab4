### 1:
Since ```num1``` and ```num2``` were both input with type String into the 
```calculateSum``` function, the returned value concatenated them as strings rather than add them, resulting in a 2 digit number made of the inputs. 

### 2:
I cast both values to Numbers before the ```+``` operation is done.
