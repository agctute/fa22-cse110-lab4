## 1:
I am not going to remember all of the JavaScript type comparisons, and they will eventually create a bug that will take me a day or two to fix. Think of the sheer amount of lost productivity that will/has come of this. For its asynchronous nature, it may allow some elements to load in before others unintentionally. The diversity of web platforms also makes it so that compatibility with certain features needs to be checked for every platform. 

## 2:
By Occam's Razor, it is because they have no souls. 

## 3:
Compiled languaged must be translated into machine code before execution, and compilation errors stop the program, whilst interpreted languages and run immediately, albeit slower, and can be debugged during runtime. Because of this, JavaScript is more flexible with how it can be debugged, but runs slower.

Mastering JavaScirpt provides a solid foundation of learning which can translate across different frameworks. Not learning a framework immediately put one behind on hireability. 

## 5:
There are too many ways JS can be used in our project. Listing them now while we're in the brainstorming phase would be exhausting, and since this is optional, I'd rather not.
