# Part 1
## Question 1:
"values added: 20"

## Question 2:
"final result: 20"

## Question 3:
"values added: 20"

## Question 4:
The code returns an error since the  ```result``` variable is not defined outside of the ```if``` block. 

## Question 5 and 6:
The code returns an error at line 4 since the code attempted to reassign ```result``` to a new value. Hence neither line 9 or 13 were ever reached before an error was returned.
