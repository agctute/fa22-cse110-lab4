# Part 2
## Question 1:
The code returns 3 because that is the last value that ```i``` is assigned (and also because the log function remains in function).

## Question 2:
The code returns 150 for the same reasons stated in Question 1, but with ```discountedPrice``` instead of ```i```.

## Question 3:
The code returns 150 for the same reasons stated in Question 1, but with ```finalPrice``` instead of ```i```.

## Question 4:
The function returns [50, 100, 150] since ```discounted``` is defined in the scope of the function.

## Question 5:
The code returns an error since ```i``` is only defined in the scope of the ```for``` loop

## Question 6:
The code returns an error since ```discountedPrice``` is only defined in the scope of the ```for``` loop

## Question 7:
The code will return 150 since ```finalPrice``` is still defined in the scope of the function even with the use of ```let```

## Question 8:
