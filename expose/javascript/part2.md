# Part 2
## Question 1:
The code returns 3 because that is the last value that ```i``` is assigned (and also because the log function remains in function).

## Question 2:
The code returns 150 for the same reasons stated in Question 1, but with ```discountedPrice``` instead of ```i```.

## Question 3:
The code returns 150 for the same reasons stated in Question 1, but with ```finalPrice``` instead of ```i```.

## Question 4:
The function returns [50, 100, 150] since ```discounted``` is defined in the scope of the function.

## Question 5:
The code returns an error since ```i``` is only defined in the scope of the ```for``` loop

## Question 6:
The code returns an error since ```discountedPrice``` is only defined in the scope of the ```for``` loop

## Question 7:
The code will return 150 since ```finalPrice``` is still defined in the scope of the function even with the use of ```let```

## Question 8:
The function will return [50, 100, 150] since, the ```discounted``` is in the scope of the function and hence values can be pushed to it and it can be returned. 

## Question 9:
The code returns an error since ```i``` is only defined in the scope of the ```for``` loop

## Question 10:
The code prints 3 since ```length``` is defined within the same scope as the log and is never changed. 

## Question 11:
the function returns [50, 100, 150] since the ```const``` declaration only defines the reference to the ```discounted``` array as immutable, but the array itself can still be changed. 

## Question 12:
### A:
```student.name```

### B:
```student['Grad Year']```

### C:
```student.greeting()```

### D:
```student['Favorite Teacher'].name```

### E:
```student.courseload[0]```

## Question 13:
